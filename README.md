## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a profile card component that looks as close as possible to the provided design. The component should be responsive and work well on all screen sizes.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles

### What I Learned

- How to use `rem` units for responsive design.
- How to position elements absolutely and relatively to create overlapping effects.
- How to use CSS Flexbox for layout alignment.
- How to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:
- Improving accessibility.
- Using CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Exploring animations and transitions for better user interaction.
